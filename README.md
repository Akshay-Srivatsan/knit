Knit is a build tool inspired by Make and Plan9 mk. You define rules with a
Make-like syntax within a Lua program. Knit also tracks more of your build to
give you better incremental builds. For example, Knit automatically tracks
recipes that are executed across builds, so changing a variable (even at the
command-line) can cause a rule to be rebuilt because Knit can see that the
recipe depends on the variable.

Knit is very much in-progress and there may be bugs. I am still in the process
of adding enough features so that I can convert my projects to Knit.

# Improvements over Make

* Knit uses Lua for customization, rather than the Make custom language.
* Knit tracks recipe changes, so if you update a variable (in the Knitfile or
  at the command-line), any dependent rules will be automatically rebuilt.
* Knit supports `%` meta-rules and regular expression meta-rules. Make only
  supports `%` meta-rules.
* Make requires tab characters for indentation, Knit does not.
* Make uses special targets such as `.SECONDARY` to indicate special
  processing. Knit uses rule attributes.
* Knit supports virtual attributes that are independent of the file system.
* Knit uses sane variable names like `$input`, `$output`, and `$match` instead
  of `$^`, `$@`, and `$*`.
* Knit builds using all cores by default.

# Installation

Prebuilt binary:

```
eget zyedidia/knit --pre-release
```

From source:

```
go install github.com/zyedidia/knit/cmd/knit@latest
```

# Example Knitfile

Here is an example Knitfile used for building a simple C project.

```lua
knit = import("knit")

cc = cli.cc or "gcc"
debug = tobool(cli.debug) or false

cflags := -Wall

if debug then
    cflags := $cflags -Og -g
else
    cflags := $cflags -O2
end

src = knit.glob("*.c")
obj = knit.extrepl(src, ".c", ".o")
prog := hello

return r{
$ $prog: $obj
    $cc $cflags $input -o $output

$ %.o: %.c
    $cc $cflags -c $input -o $output

$ clean:VB:
    rm -f $obj $prog
}
```
